This repository contains the solutions of the problems I've solved on leetcode, the different approaches used to solve different types of problems.

I've been following Striver's A2Z DS Algo course since December 2024 and aim to solve over 400+ over the next 6 months. 

Solving & sharing my progress on this platform has provided me a system to stay consistent with my DSA journey of mastery. 

I hope that I can provide you guys with a comprehensive solutions of DSA problems topic wise on a regular basis. Thank you !!!
